<p align="center">
  B7Burguer is a modern and responsive landing page project designed for a fictional burger restaurant.  
  The main goal of this project is to practice and showcase front-end development skills using **HTML, CSS**,  
  and responsive design techniques to deliver a clean and attractive user experience.  
  While it currently focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a landing page,  
  I plan to continue its development in the future by adding a back-end,  
  transforming it into a fully functional application with dynamic content and real data management.
